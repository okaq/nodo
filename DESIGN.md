Design Notes

AQ <aq@okaq.com>

game boards for turn based startegy

insight here is that all game state

stored and processsed in gpu / webgl

using raw shaders and custom vertex attributes

what do we gain from this? nothing!

its just an exploration for future grids

Paint The Floor

a remarkably simple html5 / mobile game

a grid of blocks with obstacle points

and each arrow key press or swipe

paints a trail along a line until it reaches a block

objective: fill the grid in the least possible moves

no need for AI solver, just generate maze ahead of time

Geometry Buffer / Shader Material in threejs

setting up the generater for grid space

treated like a bitmap of pixels / blocks

each vertex quad forms a pair of triangles

double loop over x-y points in the grid

vertices generated by loop aligned as triangle pairs

each triangle pair forms a quad in buffer geometry

plane geometry abstracts the internals to N triangle mesh
