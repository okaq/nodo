Design Notes

AQ <aq@okaq.com>

game boards for turn based startegy

insight here is that all game state

stored and processsed in gpu / webgl

using raw shaders and custom vertex attributes

what do we gain from this? nothing!

its just an exploration for future grids

Paint The Floor

a remarkably simple html5 / mobile game

a grid of blocks with obstacle points

and each arrow key press or swipe

paints a trail along a line until it reaches a block

objective: fill the grid in the least possible moves

no need for AI solver, just generate maze ahead of time

Geometry Buffer / Shader Material in threejs

setting up the generater for grid space

treated like a bitmap of pixels / blocks

each vertex quad forms a pair of triangles

double loop over x-y points in the grid

vertices generated by loop aligned as triangle pairs

each triangle pair forms a quad in buffer geometry

plane geometry abstracts the internals to N triangle mesh

cloud architecture - aws s3, cloudflare workers

webgl indicates counter clockwise triangle winding

triangle quad unrolled with explicit vertices

vertex and fragment shaders defined as template (string) literals

template literals flex: inline expressions and tagged functions 

update buffer geometry custom attributes via shader uniforms

or via mesh object properties such as position rotation scale

per vertex color transforms mapped to time and math function uniforms

grid generators themselves are equivalent to lattice vector defines

for a single server vm (large) and many web browser client game

our latency for turn based strategy, peer to peer, or shared experience play

is on order of 1 fps in webgl

and one minute per global "turn" in server side global game state

simply process updates from players as they arrive, in blocks of one minute turns

design the game around the cloud mediated peer net
